CUSTOM MENUITEMS
================

See https://docs.google.com/a/canonical.com/document/d/1OyHUg_uUfmhDNa-9UrMc1tZ_eH_99PEU_V2l1YFA1UY/edit#
for visual mockups of how these should look.

 * Transfer
   - x-canonical-type         s "com.canonical.indicator.transfer"
   - x-canonical-uid          s the transfer's unique identifier string
   - icon                     v the icon for the app receiving the download
   - label                    s human-readable string describing the transfer

 * Bulk Action Menuitem
   This behaves like a normal text menuitem but is rendered differently;
   see the the "Pause all" / "Clear all" buttons in the mockup linked above.
   - x-canonical-type         s "com.canonical.indicator.transfer-bulk-action"
   - label                    s label
