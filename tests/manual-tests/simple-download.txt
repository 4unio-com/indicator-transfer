Steps:

1. Start the new build of indicator-transfer-service

2. Run "$python2 tests/manual-tests/simple-download.py"

3. Immediately after launching the script, click or pull down on
   the indicator so that the menu is visible and its menuitems
   can be observed.

   [ ] The transfers should initially appear in the 'Ongoing Transfers'
       section, whose bulk-action button should read 'Pause all'.

   [ ] While active, the transfer indicator's header indicates that
       there are active transfer(s).

   [ ] As each transfer finishes, it moves from the 'Ongoing'
       section to the 'Successful Transfers' section

   [ ] When the last transfer finishes, the header changes to
       indicate that the download manager is idle

   [ ] When the last transfer finishes, the 'Ongoing Tranfers'
       section's bulk action button should disappear.

4. After the transfers finish, press the 'Clear all' button.

   [ ] 'Clear all' should remove all three completed transfers from
       the 'Successful Transfers' section of the menu.

   [ ] After the transfers are cleared, the section's
       bulk action button should disappear.
