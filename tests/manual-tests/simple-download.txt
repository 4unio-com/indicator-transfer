Steps:

0. NB: the transfer menuitems may not be visible until the menuitem
   x-canonical-type "com.canonical.indicator.transfer" is supported
   by the renderer. Until then, if you're willing and able to build
   manually, you can force them to look like normal menuitems by
   removing these two lines from src/view-gmenu.cpp's
   create_transfer_menuitem():

   > g_menu_item_set_attribute (menu_item, "x-canonical-type",
   >                            "s", "com.canonical.indicator.transfer");


1. Start the new build of indicator-transfer-service

2. Run "$python2 tests/manual-tests/simple-download.py"

3. Immediately after launching the script, click or pull down on
   the indicator so that the menu is visible and its menuitems
   can be observed.

   [ ] The transfers should initially appear in the 'Ongoing Transfers'
       section, whose bulk-action button should read 'Pause all'.

   [ ] While active, the transfer indicator's header indicates that
       there are active transfer(s).

   [ ] As each transfer finishes, it moves from the 'Ongoing'
       section to the 'Successful Transfers' section

   [ ] When the last transfer finishes, the header changes to
       indicate that the download manager is idle

4. After the transfers finish, press the 'Clear all' button.

   [ ] 'Clear all' should remove all three completed transfers from
       the 'Successful Transfers' section of the menu.
