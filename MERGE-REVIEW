=== Simple Download Test ===

Steps:

 1. '''NB''': the transfer menuitems may not be visible until the menuitem x-canonical-type "com.canonical.indicator.transfer" is supported by the renderer. Until then, if you're willing and able to build manually, you can force them to look like normal menuitems by removing these two lines from src/view-gmenu.cpp's create_transfer_menuitem():
 {{{
 g_menu_item_set_attribute (menu_item, "x-canonical-type",
                            "s", "com.canonical.indicator.transfer");
 }}}

 1. Start the new build of indicator-transfer-service

 1. Run "$python2 tests/manual-tests/simple-download.py"

 1. Immediately after launching the script, click or pull down on the indicator so that the menu is visible and its menuitems can be observed

   1. [ ] The transfers initially appear in the 'Ongoing Transfers' section and the section's button is 'Pause all'

   1. [ ] While active, the transfer indicator's header indicates that there are active transfer(s).

   1. [ ] As each transfer finishes, it moves from the 'Ongoing' section to the 'Successful Transfers' section

   1. [ ] When the last transfer finishes, the header changes to indicate that the download manager is idle

 1. After the transfers finish, press the 'Clear all' button.

   1. [ ] 'Clear all' should remove all three completed transfers from the 'Successful Transfers' section of the menu.
