This documents the expections that the project has on what both submitters
and reviewers should ensure that they've done for a merge into the project.

= IMPORTANT NOTICE =

 The menu items may not be visible until the x-canonical-types
 "com.canonical.indicator.transfer" and "com.canonical.indicator.bulk-action"
 are supported by the renderer. Until then, if you're willing to build
 manually, you can force them to look like normal menuitems by removing these
 two lines from src/view-gmenu.cpp's create_transfer_menuitem():

  > g_menu_item_set_attribute (menu_item, "x-canonical-type",
  >                            "s", "com.canonical.indicator.transfer");

 and these two lines from the same file's create_bulk_action_menuitem():

  > const char * type = "com.canonical.indicator.transfer-bulk-action";
  > g_menu_item_set_attribute (menu_item, "x-canonical-type", "s", type);


== Submitter Responsibilities ==

 * Ensure the project compiles and the test suite executes without error
 * Ensure that non-obvious code has comments explaining it
 * Ensure the manual tests in tests/manual-tests/ pass

== Reviewer Responsibilities ==

 * Did the Jenkins build compile? Pass? Run unit tests successfully?
 * Are there appropriate tests to cover any new functionality?
 * Confirm that the manual tests pass
